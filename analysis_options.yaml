# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.

# For a list of lints, see: http://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/

# for the CMiC Code Standard for Flutter.
#
# We use the cmic_lints package, https://github.com/CMiC-Flutter/cmic_lints,
# which activates a set of recommended lints for CMiC Flutter apps, packages,
# and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the section
  # below to disable rules from the `package:cmic_lints/cmic_lints.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules.
  #
  # Generally, unless there is a specific requirement for this project, please
  # discuss any changes to the linter rule set with the Flutter Code Reviewers'
  # meeting group or in the Flutter channel. It is preferable to make changes to
  # the cmic_lints package rather than adding or disabling rules here.
